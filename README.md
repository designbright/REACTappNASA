Activity: React Props and State - Pair Programming

Instructions  

In this activity you are given a simple 'NASA' react app that is broken. Right now the following events are not being handled by the react app:

form's submission
Comment text change
Author's text change

App description  

The app serves two purposes. It renders an article and image (It fetches these from the NASA API), and a user can leave a comment using a form.

Problems to Solve  

When you fill out a comment form and press submit, the application should:

Append a comment to the comment listing
Clear out the author name and comment text upon submission

Hints  

We've already written the handlers (handleCommentTextChange, handleNameChange, handleFormSubmit) for you.

Remember to set both the onChange and the value attributes for the inputs.
